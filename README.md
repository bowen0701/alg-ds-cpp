# Learn C++

The repo is to collect my practices for learning C++.

## C++ Workflow

- Write your C++ program and save it to the file `<filename>.cc` in file extension `.cc`.
- Compile the file by running `g++ -o <filename>.out <filename>.cc`, then this step produces a new file `<filename>.out` which is executable.  
- Finally, to obtain the result execute `./<filename>.out`.

```bash
# Write your C++ program.
vim <filename>.cc

# Compile your program.
g++ -o <filename>.out <filename>.cc

# Execute compiled output.
./<filename>.out
```

Stay tuned.
