# Learn C++

The repo is to collect my practices for learning C++.

## C++ Workflow

- Write your C++ program and save it in the file `<file>.cc` with file extension `.cc`.
- Compile the file by running `g++ -o <file>.out <file>.cc`, then this step produces a new file `<file>.out` which is executable.  
- Finally, to obtain the result execute `./<file>.out`.

Stay tuned.
