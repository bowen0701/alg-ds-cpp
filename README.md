# Learn C++

The repo is to collect my practices for learning C++.

## C++ Flow

- Write your C++ program and save it in `<file>.cc` file extension.
- Compile the file by running `g++ -o <file>.out <file>.cc`, then this produced a new file `<file>.out` which is executable.  
- Finally, to obtain the result execute `<file>.out`.

Stay tuned.
