# C++ Implementation of Algorithms and Data Structures

This repo is collect my C++ implementation of algorithms and data structures.

Why algorithms and data structures? Because both are important for us who want to work on machine learning research and engineering. More importantly, it is a lot of fun. :-)

## How to Compile C++ Codes?
- Install `g++` on Macbook: just type `g++` in Terminal and then execute it.
- Write your C++ scripts and save it to the file `<file>.cc` in file extension `.cc`.
- Compile the file by running the following scripts; this step will produce an executable output file `<file>.out`.
  ```bash
  # Compile code in C++14.
  g++ -std=c++14 <file>.cc -o <file>.out
  ```
- Finally, execute the output file.
  ```bash
  ./<file>.out
  ```
