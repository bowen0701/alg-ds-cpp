# C++ Implementation of Algorithms and Data Structures

## Introduction

- Write our C++ program and save it to the file `<file>.cc` in file extension `.cc`. Note that all of the C++ scripts here are writen in C++11.
- Compile the file by running the following; this step will produce an executable file `<file>.out`.
```bash
g++ -std=c++11 <file>.cc -o <file>.out
```
- Finally, execute the file.
```bash
./<file>.out
```

To install `g++` on Macbook, just type `g++` in Terminal and then execute it.
