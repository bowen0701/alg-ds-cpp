# C++ Implementation of Algorithms and Data Structures

This repo is collect my C++ implementation of algorithms and data structures.

## Introduction

How to implement and compile C++ scripts?
- Install `g++` on Macbook: just type `g++` in Terminal and then execute it.
- Write your C++ scripts and save it to the file `<file>.cc` in file extension `.cc`.
- Compile the file by running the following scripts; this step will produce an executable output file `<file>.out`.
  ```bash
  # Compile code in C++14.
  g++ -std=c++14 <file>.cc -o <file>.out
  ```
- Finally, execute the output file.
  ```bash
  ./<file>.out
  ```
