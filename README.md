# C++ Implementation of Algorithms and Data Structures

## Workflow

- Write our C++ program and save it to the file `<file>.cc` in file extension `.cc`. Note that all of the C++ scripts here are writen in C++11.
- Compile the file by running `g++ -std=c++11 <file>.cc -o <file>.out`, then this step produces a new file `<file>.out` which is executable.  
- Finally, execute `./<file>.out`.

```bash
# Write your C++ program.
vim file.cc

# Compile your program.
g++ -std=c++11 file.cc -o file.out

# Execute compiled output.
./file.out
```

To install `g++` on Macbook, just type `g++` in Terminal and then execute it.
