/*Leetcode 51. N-Queens.
Hard.

URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an nxn chessboard 
such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement,
where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

Example:
Input: 4
Output: [
 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
  "...Q",
  "Q...",
  "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
  "Q...",
  "...Q",
  ".Q.."]
]
Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle 
as shown above.
